# Personal-Portfolio
 This is a personal portfolio of work I wanted to create to showcase my skills and talents to future employers.
 
 ##Contents
I structured my portfolio website in a way that I can first introduce myself personally and professionall;then list the languages within my current domain; and lastly showcase different projects that I've been working on.
Lastly, I have added a Contact section for future employers to share their contact information with me so that I can reach out to them for possible job offers.
